# Node.js Tour API

This project is a simple RESTful API for managing tour data. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tours. It is built using Node.js, Express, and basic file-based storage for data management.

   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash

## Middleware

1. **Morgan** - Logs HTTP requests in the console when the app is running in development mode.
2. **Express JSON Parser** - Parses incoming JSON requests and makes the data available in `req.body`.
3. **Static File Serving** - Serves static files from the `public` directory.
4. **Custom Middleware** - Demonstrates basic middleware functions, including logging and adding a timestamp to the request object.
